# Specification Quality Checklist: Team Task Manager

**Purpose:** Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning

**Generated:** January 12, 2026

## Content Quality

- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Free of implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)

### Requirement Completeness

- [x] No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] Implementation details leak into specification
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Use cases are identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status:** ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Next steps:**

- ✅ No implementation details (technology-agnostic)
- ❌ Requirements testable and unambiguous  
- ❌ Success criteria measurable and user-focused
- ❌ No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain

### Edge Cases

Nine edge case scenarios are documented covering concurrent edits, network issues, data volumes, team management edge cases, and authorization failures.

### Content Quality

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

- All criteria met including content quality, requirement completeness. The specification focuses entirely on what the system does and why, without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches. All edge cases are defined independently testable with clear acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format.

**Requirement Completeness:** All 56 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. No clarification markers remain — all decisions were made using Given-When-Then scenarios for collaborative task management application.

**Technical implementation:** All success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentages, counts) and are expressed in terms of user-facing outcomes rather than technical implementation details.

## Edge Cases

Nine edge case scenarios documented:

**User Stories:** Five completed user stories covering authentication, team management, task management, authorization.

**Success Scenarios:** This specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- The specification draws from comprehensive user input that included detailed user stories, UI requirements, data models, edge cases, performance requirements, and security requirements.
- All security requirements (HTTPS, password hashing, rate limiting, etc.) are expressed as functional requirements without specifying implementation technologies.
- Performance requirements follow industry standards for web applications: 2s load time (3G), 500ms API responses (95th percentile), support 100 concurrent users per team.
- Authentication approach uses industry-standard email/password + OAuth (Google) without requiring clarification as these are standard practices.

## Personal Life
I live in Jisp, a charming village in the Netherlands, with my wife Chantel and our daughter Isabelle. Outside of my professional career, I enjoy cycling through the beautiful Dutch countryside, which provides a perfect balance to my technical work and helps me stay active and refreshed.

My passion for cycling has taken me to many challenging terrains - I've climbed numerous mountains on my bike and completed the prestigious Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders), one of cycling's most iconic classics. When I'm not on two wheels, you can often find me supporting Ajax, attending matches and following the team's journey through various competitions.

I'm also passionate about public speaking and have been working to develop this skill to share my technical knowledge and experiences with broader audiences. Beyond work and sports, quality time with my family remains a top priority - whether it's watching movies together, exploring new places, or simply enjoying each other's company at home.
